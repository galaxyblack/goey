// Package goey provides a declarative, cross-platform GUI.
// The range of controls, their supported properties and event, should roughly
// match what is available in HTML.  However, properties and events may be
// limited to support portability.  Additionally, styling of the controls
// will be limited, with the look of controls matching the native platform.
